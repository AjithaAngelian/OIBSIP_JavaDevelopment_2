# 🎮 Number Guessing Game - Java Project

## 📌 Objective
The **Number Guessing Game** is a fun and interactive Java-based console application where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it. The game provides feedback on whether the user's guess is too high or too low and allows multiple rounds with scoring based on the number of attempts.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- **Language**: Java  
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code  
- **JDK**: Java Development Kit 17 or above  
- **Build/Run**: Java CLI (javac & java commands) or VS Code Terminal  

---

## 🧩 Steps Performed
1. **Random Number Generation**  
   - The system generates a random number between 1 and 100 using Java’s `Random` class.

2. **User Input Handling**  
   - The user is prompted to guess the number via console input.
   - Input validation ensures the guess is within the valid range.

3. **Game Logic**  
   - The system gives hints like “Too High” or “Too Low” based on the guess.
   - A maximum of **10 attempts** is allowed per round.

4. **Scoring System**  
   - Points are awarded based on the number of attempts taken to guess the correct number.
   - The fewer the attempts, the higher the score.

5. **Multiple Rounds**  
   - After each round, the user can choose to play again.
   - The total score is accumulated and displayed at the end of all rounds.
